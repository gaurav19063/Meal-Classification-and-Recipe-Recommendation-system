Cook with the surrounding fat still attached, then remove after cooking, if you prefer. The fat adds flavour as well as basting the meat during cooking.  Fillet: The most expensive cut. Allow 100-125g per head. It is very lean and, because it has short fibres, very tender. Ask for a piece cut from the middle of the fillet, not the end. Also, ensure that the butcher removes the sinewy chain that runs down the side. I like to cook my steaks split in half lengthways, not the usual round medallion shape.  T-bone: Generally 350-400g each, including bone. It has a good marbling of fat with a layer of creamy fat on one side \u2013 this should be left on for cooking, then removed if you like. You get about 200-250g of meat, with a sirloin on one side of the bone and a fillet on the other. You also get some marrow in the bone which can be spread on the cooked meat.", "To cook your steaks, heat a frying pan \u2013 to a moderate heat for fillet, hot for T-bone or very hot for rib-eye.

For fillet steak, cook the rounded edges too, turning to seal them well.", "If you\u2019re cooking fillet or rib-eye steaks, add a knob of butter to the pan, allow to foam a little and baste the steaks. T-bone steak has plenty of fat, so simply spoon it over the meat as it renders down. Remove steaks to a plate and allow to rest for at least 5 mins. Trim off any unwanted fat.", "Slice fillet or rib-eye steak along the grain, then arrange on a plate with your chosen sauce and side dish.
